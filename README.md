- Currently in Development (Frontend)

Create a component for adding and searching items, the user can add items and search for a specific item from the list.
The component should also have a navbar at the top with these user details (username, profile picture, email), you can use static data for these fields.
The UI part is completely left to your creativity and imagination. It tests your designing and styling capabilities, but make sure it is subtle.
Also try to implement throttling or debouncing in your search function it will be an added advantage. (frontend)
